Apart from this I have created two tools, one for debug sync issues which accelerate work and unblock team from syncing environment issues and Second tool is used to debug data most of the time we have data issues but it takes a lot of time of multiple teams to track and find the root cause, this tool is used to explore database (couchbase-lite and sqlite) and query on the database to find out specific data. Both the tools are opensource and easy to inject in any android project.\nApart from this I am working on application for cruise to manage activities, customers and provide them best checkin, onboard/ashore facilities.",
